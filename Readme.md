Mitty is a collection of programs that enable us to generate simulated genomic data to test our algorithms.

Mitty generates simulated data by starting from a reference genome and then adding controlled mutations to it to create
a variant "sample" genome. Mitty can also simulate populations of genomes derived via sexual reproduction. Mitty can
then generating reads from the chromosomes of the mutated genome(s). 

At each stage of this process we know the origins of the data and so we know

- The correct alignment of each read
- The correct variants in the "sample" that these reads came from.

**The data generated by Mitty can, therefore, be used to test the correctness of aligners and variant callers under
different conditions and data set characteristics.**

Mitty, at its heart, is a set of command line programs that are called with various parameters to generate different 
simulated data. Mitty has, additionally, been wrapped for the Seven Bridges Genomics computation platform (IGOR) and
can be used from that platform to generate simulated data.

The important components of Mitty are described as::

    Reference Genome  + denovo.py  --> .vcf file    : random mutations of various kinds representing a "sample"
    
    Reference Genome  + population.py  --> lot of .vcf files    : a "population"
      
    .vcf file + vcf2reads.py       --> .fastq file  : perfect and corrupted reads from "sample"
    
    .fastq file + reads2bam.py     --> .bam file    : perfect alignment of "sample" reads to original reference
